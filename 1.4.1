Characteristics of big data>

The 5 v's of big data describe the characteristics of big data :

I.)   VOLUME: The name 'Big Data' itself is related to a size which is enormous. Size of data plays very
      crucial role in determining value out of data. Also, whether a particular data can actually be considered
      as a Big Data or not, is dependent upon volume of data. Hence, 'Volume' is one characteristic which needs
      to be considered while dealing with 'Big Data'.
      
II.)  VELOCITY:the speed at which data is generated and retrived from a huge amount of data.The term 'velocity' 
      refers to the speed of generation of data. How fast the data is generated and processed to meet the demands,
      determines real potential in the data.

      Big Data Velocity deals with the speed at which data flows in from sources like business processes, 
      application logs, networks and social media sites, sensors, mobile devices, etc. The flow of data is
      massive and continuous.
      
III.) VARIETY: The next aspect of 'Big Data' is its variety.

      Variety refers to heterogeneous sources and the nature of data, both structured and unstructured. 
      During earlier days, spreadsheets and databases were the only sources of data considered by most 
      of the applications. Now days, data in the form of emails, photos, videos, monitoring devices, PDFs,
      audio, etc. is also being considered in the analysis applications. This variety of unstructured data
      poses certain issues for storage, mining and analysing data.
      
IV.)  VERACITY: Big Data Veracity refers to the biases, noise and abnormality in data. Is the data that 
      is being stored veracity in data analysis is the biggest challenge.
      
V.)   VALUE: The costs of compute, storage, and connectivity resources are plunging, and new technologies
      like scanners, smartphones,video, and other data-collectors mean that there is a huge volumes of 
      data what was available even five to 10 years ago.We capture every mouse click, phone call, text 
      message, Web search, transaction, and more. As the volume of data grows, we can learn more â€“ but
      only if we uncover the meaningful relationships and patterns.
