	Diference between scale up and scale out:
  
  SCALE UP : 
  > it consumes more money and time as well the reliabilty will be low.
  > Scaling up is taking what you’ve got, and replacing it with something more powerful.
  From a networking perspective, this could be taking a 1GbE switch, and replacing it 
  with a 10GbE switch. Same number of switchports, but the bandwidth has been scaled 
  up via bigger pipes. The 1GbE bottleneck has been relieved by the 10GbE replacement.
	
	
SCALE OUT : 
  > rather than scale up this will be contrast where co ordianation is better since 
  machines were shared with work as well machine failure will be handled.
  > Scaling out takes the infrastructure you’ve got, and replicates it to work in parallel.
  This has the effect of increasing infrastructure capacity roughly linearly. Data centers
  often scale out using pods. Build a compute pod, spin up applications to use it, then scale
  out by building another pod to add capacity. Actual application performance may not be linear, 
  as application architectures must be written to work effectively in a scale-out environment.
  
  
  Scale-up -> can solve a capacity problem without adding infrastructure elements such as network 
connectivity. However, it does require additional space, power, and cooling. Scaling up does 
not add controller capabilities to handle additional host activities. That means it doesn’t 
add costs for extra control functions either.
So the costs have not scaled at the same rate for the initial storage system plus storage 
devices – only additional devices have been added.
 
Scale-out -> storage usually requires additional storage (called nodes) to add capacity and 
performance. Or in the case of monolithic storage systems, it scales by adding more functional
elements (usually controller cards).One difference between scaling out and just putting more
storage systems on the floor is that scale-out storage continues to be represented as a single system
